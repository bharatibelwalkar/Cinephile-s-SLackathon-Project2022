# Cinephile's SLackathon-Project2022
As a student of the Simplilearn PGP in Data Science program, this repository is for my SLackathon idea submission. 


### Cautionary Note. 
If you are expecting an idea that is going to solve a crucial problem for a humankind and/or change the world, this is certainly not the submission. Anyway, hope you enjoy reading it! ;)


## Brief Background
I consider myself a huge cinephile, or in more colloquial language – a  movie buff. Growing up, I was scolded a number of times for watching television for a prolonged period of time. My parents had almost given up hopes of my bright academic future, assuming that I was too distracted by movies, actors/actresses, dancing, songs, and whatnot. And, all this was because I loved watching movies... I still do! Anyway, I am not here to talk about how much I love watching them. Well…, in a way, I am here to talk about movies but with a slight (data science) twist. With this SLackathon submission, I am trying to combine what I love (movies) with what I want to love (data science)!

 

## What is the problem?
Due to the rise of online video streaming, several over-the-top (OTT) streaming services/platforms are competing for viewers' attention, money, and time (Lad et al., 2020). Needless to say, our email inboxes, social media pages, and/or television commercial breaks are inundated with "special offers" and advertisements from various OTTs, like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Hotstar, HBO, Acorn to name a few. For an average household, subscribing to a limited number of OTTs may be possible; however, it may not be a wise option for specific populations (e.g., international students or young professionals living away from their families). I remember, as a poor international student back in the days, I would sign up for a free 1-month subscription to check out their offerings (and be confused which one to pick). But let's be honest - how much can you really gauge (and, more importantly, compare) their offerings on your specific selection criteria (e.g., cost, quality of movies and shows)? Perhaps not very well! And even if you are able to do it, it would be tremendously time-consuming (and likely a silly move). I am, therefore, proposing to find an answer to the question: Which OTT streaming service has the best offerings? 



## The idea
This submission idea stemmed from my desire to hopefully help those who want to choose the right OTT streaming service, which will give them the most bang for their bucks. Among the top OTTs, Netflix (177.7 million viewers), Amazon Prime (152.6 million viewers), Hulu (125.8 million viewers), and Disney+ (109.8 million viewers) are the top four OTTs in the market (Insider Intelligence, 2022; Maglio, 2022). Note that, to limit my analyses, I have selected OTTs that have 100+ million viewership. My Plan is to use Kaggle datasets of these OTT service providers and specially compare these platforms on the available movies and TV shows that are uniquely offered by them. The lists of unique offerings across these four OTTs will be evaluated based on such specific criteria as range of release year, award winning content, and variety of content. Finally, the obtained results will be further evaluated in the light of their pricing models.         



## How can technology help?
I wish I were proficient in data science during my masters back in early 2010s (note: I am still not very good but trying) to be able to solve this problem for me back then. My Plan is to use Python for analyses. I am yet to fully strategize how I plan to run the needed analysis, but here's how I think it will go: (a) clean each OTT data file, (b) merge them and remove redundancies (i.e., movies/shows common across all OTTs), (c) run descriptive analyses on the remaining unique entries based on variables of interest, (d) compare them to the 1927-2020 Oscars Award list, and lastly (e) inspect the results in the light of their pricing model.
